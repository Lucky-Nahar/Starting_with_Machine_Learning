# 📊 Data Collection & Fetching Pipeline

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook **`Data Collection.ipynb`** that demonstrates multiple methods of **data collection** commonly used in data science and analytics workflows.

The notebook focuses on fetching structured and unstructured data from different sources and converting it into a usable format for analysis.

---

## 📌 Features Covered

The notebook explains and demonstrates the following data collection techniques:

### 1️⃣ Database Data Fetching (MySQL)

* Connecting Python with **MySQL databases**
* Fetching data using SQL queries
* Loading database tables into **Pandas DataFrames**
* Useful for real-world enterprise and analytics applications

### 2️⃣ API Data Fetching

* Collecting data from **REST APIs**
* Handling JSON responses
* Converting API data into structured tabular format
* Widely used in modern data-driven applications

### 3️⃣ Web Scraping

* Extracting data directly from **HTML web pages**
* Parsing and cleaning scraped data
* Useful when APIs or databases are not available
