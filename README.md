# 🚀 Starting with Machine Learning

This repository documents my **step-by-step journey of learning Machine Learning from scratch**.
I am learning concepts one by one and pushing my progress here to maintain consistency, revision, and public accountability.

The goal of this repository is **learning by doing** — understanding concepts, implementing them in code, and improving gradually.

## 📌 About This Repository

* 🔰 Beginner-friendly Machine Learning learning path
* 📚 Concepts learned sequentially (no random jumps)
* 🧪 Hands-on practice using **Python & Jupyter Notebooks**
* 📝 Notes, explanations, and experiments included
* 📈 Will be updated regularly as I learn new topics

This repository is **not a final project**, but a **learning log**.
